user documentation

The user can navigate the site using the sidebar located on the left side of the page.

Each member of the group has their own page containing their presentation material.

These pages can be navigated by scrolling down until all the content on the page has been seen.

Users can click images contained on the site to receive a full screen view of the image.

Documentation is also located on the sidebar so unfamiliar users can find it quickly if needed.
 
One of the pages of the site (Jenny.html) contains a button that the user can click to be redirected to another page containing the included diagram.
